# DAND_Gapminder_Exercises

The object of this project was to download a data set of my choice from Gapminder website and create 2-5 plots that make use of the visualizations and EDA techniques learned in pass lesson. Also, to create a post in the discussions that includes:
       1. any questions you answered, your observations, and summary statistics
       2. snippets of code that created the plots
       3. links to the images of your plots
